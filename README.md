## Building Process and Learnings

Throughout the development of this Tic Tac Toe game, I applied various concepts. Here's an overview of the building process and key learnings:

### Minimax Algorithm

I implemented the minimax algorithm for creating challenging opponents at various difficulty levels. For details, refer to the [Minimax Algorithm Article](https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/minimax).

### React and Webpack 5

I used React to create a user-friendly and modular interface. The bundling and optimization of the application's assets were handled by Webpack 5.

To elevate the user experience, I carefully integrated various elements such as icon sets, custom fonts, and interactive sound effects.
